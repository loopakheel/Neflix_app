# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix_App

The **Netflix Clone App** is an Android project built using **Kotlin** and **XML** in **Android Studio**.  
It replicates the core flow and design of the Netflix mobile interface, featuring a **splash screen**, **signup/login system**, and a **bottom navigation dashboard** with sections for **Home**, **Movies**, **TV Shows**, and **Account/Profile**.  
This project demonstrates key Android development concepts such as **activity navigation**, **UI design**, and **responsive layout structuring**, making it a great example of modern mobile app development in Kotlin.
